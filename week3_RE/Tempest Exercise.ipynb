Silence!\\nTrouble us not.\\n\\nGONZALO  Good, yet remember whom thou hast\\naboard.\\n\\nBOATSWAIN  None that I more love than myself. You are\\na councillor; if you can command these elements\\nto silence, and work the peace of the present, we\\nwill not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If\\nyou cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and\\nmake yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance\\nof the hour, if it so hap.--Cheerly, good\\nhearts!--Out of our way, I say!\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nGONZALO  I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks\\nhe hath no drowning mark upon him. His\\ncomplexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good\\nFate, to his hanging.

Lower, lower!\\nBring her to try wi\\' th\\' main course. [(A cry\\nwithin.)] A plague upon this howling!

Have you a mind to sink?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  A pox o\\' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,\\nincharitable dog!\\n\\nBOATSWAIN  Work you, then.\\n\\nANTONIO  Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent\\nnoisemaker!

O, I have suffered\\nWith those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,\\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\\nDashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\\nAgainst my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.\\nHad I been any god of power, I would\\nHave sunk the sea within the earth or ere\\nIt should the good ship so have swallowed, and\\nThe fraughting souls within her.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Be collected.\\nNo more amazement. Tell your piteous heart\\nThere\\'s no harm done.\\n\\nMIRANDA  O, woe the day!\\n\\nPROSPERO  No harm.\\nI have done nothing but in care of thee,\\nOf thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\\nArt ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing\\nOf whence I am, nor that I am more better\\nThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\\nAnd thy no greater father.\\n\\nMIRANDA  More to know\\nDid never meddle with my thoughts.\\n\\nPROSPERO  \\'Tis time\\nI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand\\nAnd pluck my magic garment from me.\\n[Putting aside his cloak.]\\nSo,\\nLie there, my art.--Wipe thou thine eyes. Have\\ncomfort.\\nThe direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched\\nThe very virtue of compassion in thee,\\nI have with such provision in mine art\\nSo safely ordered that there is no soul--\\nNo, not so much perdition as an hair,\\nBetid to any creature in the vessel\\nWhich thou heard\\'st cry, which thou saw\\'st sink. Sit\\ndown,\\nFor thou must now know farther.\\t[They sit.]\\n\\nMIRANDA  You have often\\nBegun to tell me what I am, but stopped\\nAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,\\nConcluding \"Stay. Not yet.\"\\n\\nPROSPERO  The hour\\'s now come.\\nThe very minute bids thee ope thine ear.\\nObey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\\nA time before we came unto this cell?\\nI do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not\\nOut three years old.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Certainly, sir, I can.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nBy what? By any other house or person?\\nOf anything the image tell me that\\nHath kept with thy remembrance.\\n\\nMIRANDA  \\'Tis far off\\nAnd rather like a dream than an assurance\\nThat my remembrance warrants. Had I not\\nFour or five women once that tended me?\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\\nThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\\nIn the dark backward and abysm of time?\\nIf thou rememb\\'rest aught ere thou cam\\'st here,\\nHow thou cam\\'st here thou mayst.\\n\\nMIRANDA  But that I do not.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nTwelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\\nThy father was the Duke of Milan and\\nA prince of power.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Sir, are not you my father?\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThy mother was a piece of virtue, and\\nShe said thou wast my daughter. And thy father\\nWas Duke of Milan, and his only heir\\nAnd princess no worse issued.\\n\\nMIRANDA  O, the heavens!\\nWhat foul play had we that we came from thence?\\nOr blessed was \\'t we did?\\n\\nPROSPERO  Both, both, my girl.\\nBy foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,\\nBut blessedly holp hither.\\n\\nMIRANDA  O, my heart bleeds\\nTo think o\\' th\\' teen that I have turned you to,\\nWhich is from my remembrance. Please you,\\nfarther.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nMy brother and thy uncle, called Antonio--\\nI pray thee, mark me--that a brother should\\nBe so perfidious!--he whom next thyself\\nOf all the world I loved, and to him put\\nThe manage of my state, as at that time\\nThrough all the signories it was the first,\\nAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\\nIn dignity, and for the liberal arts\\nWithout a parallel. Those being all my study,\\nThe government I cast upon my brother\\nAnd to my state grew stranger, being transported\\nAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--\\nDost thou attend me?\\n\\nMIRANDA  Sir, most heedfully.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nBeing once perfected how to grant suits,\\nHow to deny them, who t\\' advance, and who\\nTo trash for overtopping, new created\\nThe creatures that were mine, I say, or changed \\'em,\\nOr else new formed \\'em, having both the key\\nOf officer and office, set all hearts i\\' th\\' state\\nTo what tune pleased his ear, that now he was\\nThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk\\nAnd sucked my verdure out on \\'t. Thou attend\\'st not.\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nO, good sir, I do.\\n\\nPROSPERO  I pray thee, mark me.\\nI, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\\nTo closeness and the bettering of my mind\\nWith that which, but by being so retired,\\nO\\'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother\\nAwaked an evil nature, and my trust,\\nLike a good parent, did beget of him\\nA falsehood in its contrary as great\\nAs my trust was, which had indeed no limit,\\nA confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\\nNot only with what my revenue yielded\\nBut what my power might else exact, like one\\nWho, having into truth by telling of it,\\nMade such a sinner of his memory\\nTo credit his own lie, he did believe\\nHe was indeed the Duke, out o\\' th\\' substitution\\nAnd executing th\\' outward face of royalty\\nWith all prerogative. Hence, his ambition growing--\\nDost thou hear?\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nTo have no screen between this part he played\\nAnd him he played it for, he needs will be\\nAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\\nWas dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties\\nHe thinks me now incapable; confederates,\\nSo dry he was for sway, wi\\' th\\' King of Naples\\nTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,\\nSubject his coronet to his crown, and bend\\nThe dukedom, yet unbowed--alas, poor Milan!--\\nTo most ignoble stooping.\\n\\nMIRANDA  O, the heavens!\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nMark his condition and th\\' event. Then tell me\\nIf this might be a brother.\\n\\nMIRANDA  I should sin\\nTo think but nobly of my grandmother.\\nGood wombs have borne bad sons.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Now the condition.\\nThis King of Naples, being an enemy\\nTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother\\'s suit,\\nWhich was that he, in lieu o\\' th\\' premises\\nOf homage and I know not how much tribute,\\nShould presently extirpate me and mine\\nOut of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,\\nWith all the honors, on my brother; whereon,\\nA treacherous army levied, one midnight\\nFated to th\\' purpose did Antonio open\\nThe gates of Milan, and i\\' th\\' dead of darkness\\nThe ministers for th\\' purpose hurried thence\\nMe and thy crying self.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Alack, for pity!\\nI, not rememb\\'ring how I cried out then,\\nWill cry it o\\'er again. It is a hint\\nThat wrings mine eyes to \\'t.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Hear a little further,\\nAnd then I\\'ll bring thee to the present business\\nWhich now \\'s upon \\'s, without the which this story\\nWere most impertinent.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Wherefore did they not\\nThat hour destroy us?\\n\\nPROSPERO  Well demanded, wench.\\nMy tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\\nSo dear the love my people bore me, nor set\\nA mark so bloody on the business, but\\nWith colors fairer painted their foul ends.\\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\\nBore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared\\nA rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,\\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\\nInstinctively have quit it. There they hoist us\\nTo cry to th\\' sea that roared to us, to sigh\\nTo th\\' winds, whose pity, sighing back again,\\nDid us but loving wrong.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Alack, what trouble\\nWas I then to you!\\n\\nPROSPERO  O, a cherubin\\nThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,\\nInfused with a fortitude from heaven,\\nWhen I have decked the sea with drops full salt,\\nUnder my burden groaned, which raised in me\\nAn undergoing stomach to bear up\\nAgainst what should ensue.\\n\\nMIRANDA  How came we ashore?\\n\\nPROSPERO  By providence divine.\\nSome food we had, and some fresh water, that\\nA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\\nOut of his charity, who being then appointed\\nMaster of this design, did give us, with\\nRich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,\\nWhich since have steaded much. So, of his\\ngentleness,\\nKnowing I loved my books, he furnished me\\nFrom mine own library with volumes that\\nI prize above my dukedom.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Would I might\\nBut ever see that man.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [standing]  Now I arise.\\nSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\\nHere in this island we arrived, and here\\nHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\\nThan other princes can, that have more time\\nFor vainer hours and tutors not so careful.\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nHeavens thank you for \\'t. And now I pray you, sir--\\nFor still \\'tis beating in my mind--your reason\\nFor raising this sea storm?\\n\\nPROSPERO  Know thus far forth:\\nBy accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\\nNow my dear lady, hath mine enemies\\nBrought to this shore; and by my prescience\\nI find my zenith doth depend upon\\nA most auspicious star, whose influence\\nIf now I court not, but omit, my fortunes\\nWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions.\\nThou art inclined to sleep. \\'Tis a good dullness,\\nAnd give it way. I know thou canst not choose.\\n[Miranda falls asleep.]\\n[Prospero puts on his cloak.]\\nCome away, servant, come. I am ready now.\\nApproach, my Ariel. Come.\\n\\n[Enter Ariel.]\\n\\n\\nARIEL\\nAll hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come\\nTo answer thy best pleasure. Be \\'t to fly,\\nTo swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\\nOn the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task\\nAriel and all his quality.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Hast thou, spirit,\\nPerformed to point the tempest that I bade thee?\\n\\nARIEL  To every article.\\nI boarded the King\\'s ship; now on the beak,\\nNow in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\\nI flamed amazement. Sometimes I\\'d divide\\nAnd burn in many places. On the topmast,\\nThe yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,\\nThen meet and join. Jove\\'s lightning, the precursors\\nO\\' th\\' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary\\nAnd sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks\\nOf sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\\nSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\\nYea, his dread trident shake.\\n\\nPROSPERO  My brave spirit!\\nWho was so firm, so constant, that this coil\\nWould not infect his reason?\\n\\nARIEL  Not a soul\\nBut felt a fever of the mad, and played\\nSome tricks of desperation. All but mariners\\nPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\\nThen all afire with me. The King\\'s son, Ferdinand,\\nWith hair up-staring--then like reeds, not hair--\\nWas the first man that leaped; cried \"Hell is empty,\\nAnd all the devils are here.\"\\n\\nPROSPERO  Why, that\\'s my spirit!\\nBut was not this nigh shore?\\n\\nARIEL  Close by, my master.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nBut are they, Ariel, safe?\\n\\nARIEL  Not a hair perished.\\nOn their sustaining garments not a blemish,\\nBut fresher than before; and, as thou bad\\'st me,\\nIn troops I have dispersed them \\'bout the isle.\\nThe King\\'s son have I landed by himself,\\nWhom I left cooling of the air with sighs\\nIn an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,\\nHis arms in this sad knot.\\t[He folds his arms.]\\n\\nPROSPERO  Of the King\\'s ship,\\nThe mariners say how thou hast disposed,\\nAnd all the rest o\\' th\\' fleet.\\n\\nARIEL  Safely in harbor\\nIs the King\\'s ship. In the deep nook, where once\\nThou called\\'st me up at midnight to fetch dew\\nFrom the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she\\'s hid;\\nThe mariners all under hatches stowed,\\nWho, with a charm joined to their suffered labor,\\nI have left asleep. And for the rest o\\' th\\' fleet,\\nWhich I dispersed, they all have met again\\nAnd are upon the Mediterranean float,\\nBound sadly home for Naples,\\nSupposing that they saw the King\\'s ship wracked\\nAnd his great person perish.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Ariel, thy charge\\nExactly is performed. But there\\'s more work.\\nWhat is the time o\\' th\\' day?\\n\\nARIEL  Past the mid season.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nAt least two glasses. The time \\'twixt six and now\\nMust by us both be spent most preciously.\\n\\nARIEL\\nIs there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\\nLet me remember thee what thou hast promised,\\nWhich is not yet performed me.\\n\\nPROSPERO  How now? Moody?\\nWhat is \\'t thou canst demand?\\n\\nARIEL  My liberty.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nBefore the time be out? No more.\\n\\nARIEL  I prithee,\\nRemember I have done thee worthy service,\\nTold thee no lies, made no mistakings, served\\nWithout or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise\\nTo bate me a full year.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Dost thou forget\\nFrom what a torment I did free thee?\\n\\nARIEL  No.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThou dost, and think\\'st it much to tread the ooze\\nOf the salt deep,\\nTo run upon the sharp wind of the North,\\nTo do me business in the veins o\\' th\\' Earth\\nWhen it is baked with frost.\\n\\nARIEL  I do not, sir.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot\\nThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\\nWas grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?\\n\\nARIEL  No, sir.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.\\n\\nARIEL\\nSir, in Argier.\\n\\nPROSPERO  O, was she so? I must\\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\\nWhich thou forget\\'st. This damned witch Sycorax,\\nFor mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible\\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,\\nThou know\\'st, was banished. For one thing she did\\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\\n\\nARIEL  Ay, sir.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child\\nAnd here was left by th\\' sailors. Thou, my slave,\\nAs thou report\\'st thyself, was then her servant,\\nAnd for thou wast a spirit too delicate\\nTo act her earthy and abhorred commands,\\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\\nBy help of her more potent ministers\\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\\nInto a cloven pine, within which rift\\nImprisoned thou didst painfully remain\\nA dozen years; within which space she died\\nAnd left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans\\nAs fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island\\n(Save for the son that she did litter here,\\nA freckled whelp, hag-born) not honored with\\nA human shape.\\n\\nARIEL  Yes, Caliban, her son.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nDull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban\\nWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know\\'st\\nWhat torment I did find thee in. Thy groans\\nDid make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts\\nOf ever-angry bears. It was a torment\\nTo lay upon the damned, which Sycorax\\nCould not again undo. It was mine art,\\nWhen I arrived and heard thee, that made gape\\nThe pine and let thee out.\\n\\nARIEL  I thank thee, master.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nIf thou more murmur\\'st, I will rend an oak\\nAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails till\\nThou hast howled away twelve winters.\\n\\nARIEL  Pardon, master.\\nI will be correspondent to command\\nAnd do my spriting gently.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Do so, and after two days\\nI will discharge thee.\\n\\nARIEL  That\\'s my noble master.\\nWhat shall I do? Say, what? What shall I do?\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nGo make thyself like a nymph o\\' th\\' sea. Be subject\\nTo no sight but thine and mine, invisible\\nTo every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,\\nAnd hither come in \\'t. Go, hence with diligence!\\n[Ariel exits.]\\nAwake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well.\\nAwake.\\t[Miranda wakes.]\\n\\nMIRANDA  The strangeness of your story put\\nHeaviness in me.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Shake it off. Come on,\\nWe\\'ll visit Caliban, my slave, who never\\nYields us kind answer.\\n\\nMIRANDA, [rising]  \\'Tis a villain, sir,\\nI do not love to look on.\\n\\nPROSPERO  But, as \\'tis,\\nWe cannot miss him. He does make our fire,\\nFetch in our wood, and serves in offices\\nThat profit us.--What ho, slave, Caliban!\\nThou earth, thou, speak!\\n\\nCALIBAN, [within]  There\\'s wood enough within.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nCome forth, I say. There\\'s other business for thee.\\nCome, thou tortoise. When?\\n\\n[Enter Ariel like a water nymph.]\\n\\nFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,\\nHark in thine ear.\\t[He whispers to Ariel.]\\n\\nARIEL  My lord, it shall be done.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Caliban]\\nThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\\nUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!\\n\\n[Enter Caliban.]\\n\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nAs wicked dew as e\\'er my mother brushed\\nWith raven\\'s feather from unwholesome fen\\nDrop on you both. A southwest blow on you\\nAnd blister you all o\\'er.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nFor this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,\\nSide-stitches that shall pen thy breath up. Urchins\\nShall forth at vast of night that they may work\\nAll exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinched\\nAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\\nThan bees that made \\'em.\\n\\nCALIBAN  I must eat my dinner.\\nThis island\\'s mine by Sycorax, my mother,\\nWhich thou tak\\'st from me. When thou cam\\'st first,\\nThou strok\\'st me and made much of me, wouldst\\ngive me\\nWater with berries in \\'t, and teach me how\\nTo name the bigger light and how the less,\\nThat burn by day and night. And then I loved thee,\\nAnd showed thee all the qualities o\\' th\\' isle,\\nThe fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and\\nfertile.\\nCursed be I that did so! All the charms\\nOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you,\\nFor I am all the subjects that you have,\\nWhich first was mine own king; and here you sty me\\nIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\\nThe rest o\\' th\\' island.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Thou most lying slave,\\nWhom stripes may move, not kindness, I have used\\nthee,\\nFilth as thou art, with humane care, and lodged\\nthee\\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\\nThe honor of my child.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nO ho, O ho! Would \\'t had been done!\\nThou didst prevent me. I had peopled else\\nThis isle with Calibans.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Abhorred slave,\\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\\nBeing capable of all ill! I pitied thee,\\nTook pains to make thee speak, taught thee each\\nhour\\nOne thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,\\nKnow thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\\nA thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes\\nWith words that made them known. But thy vile\\nrace,\\nThough thou didst learn, had that in \\'t which good\\nnatures\\nCould not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou\\nDeservedly confined into this rock,\\nWho hadst deserved more than a prison.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nYou taught me language, and my profit on \\'t\\nIs I know how to curse. The red plague rid you\\nFor learning me your language!\\n\\nPROSPERO  Hagseed, hence!\\nFetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou \\'rt best,\\nTo answer other business. Shrugg\\'st thou, malice?\\nIf thou neglect\\'st or dost unwillingly\\nWhat I command, I\\'ll rack thee with old cramps,\\nFill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar\\nThat beasts shall tremble at thy din.\\n\\nCALIBAN  No, pray thee.\\n[Aside.] I must obey. His art is of such power\\nIt would control my dam\\'s god, Setebos,\\nAnd make a vassal of him.\\n\\nPROSPERO  So, slave, hence.\\n[Caliban exits.]\\n\\n[Enter Ferdinand; and Ariel, invisible,\\nplaying and singing.]\\n\\nSong.\\n\\nARIEL\\n\\tCome unto these yellow sands,\\n\\t   And then take hands.\\n\\tCurtsied when you have, and kissed\\n\\t   The wild waves whist.\\n\\tFoot it featly here and there,\\n\\t   And sweet sprites bear\\n\\tThe burden. Hark, hark!\\n\\t      [Burden dispersedly, within:] Bow-wow.\\n\\t   The watchdogs bark.\\n\\t      [Burden dispersedly, within:] Bow-wow.\\n\\tHark, hark! I hear\\n\\tThe strain of strutting chanticleer\\n\\t   Cry cock-a-diddle-dow.\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nWhere should this music be? I\\' th\\' air, or th\\' earth?\\nIt sounds no more; and sure it waits upon\\nSome god o\\' th\\' island. Sitting on a bank,\\nWeeping again the King my father\\'s wrack,\\nThis music crept by me upon the waters,\\nAllaying both their fury and my passion\\nWith its sweet air. Thence I have followed it,\\nOr it hath drawn me rather. But \\'tis gone.\\nNo, it begins again.\\n\\nSong.\\n\\nARIEL\\n\\tFull fathom five thy father lies.\\n\\t   Of his bones are coral made.\\n\\tThose are pearls that were his eyes.\\n\\t   Nothing of him that doth fade\\n\\tBut doth suffer a sea change\\n\\tInto something rich and strange.\\n\\tSea nymphs hourly ring his knell.\\n\\t\\t[Burden, within:] Ding dong.\\n\\tHark, now I hear them: ding dong bell.\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nThe ditty does remember my drowned father.\\nThis is no mortal business, nor no sound\\nThat the Earth owes. I hear it now above me.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Miranda]\\nThe fringed curtains of thine eye advance\\nAnd say what thou seest yond.\\n\\nMIRANDA  What is \\'t? A spirit?\\nLord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,\\nIt carries a brave form. But \\'tis a spirit.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nNo, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\\nAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seest\\nWas in the wrack; and, but he\\'s something stained\\nWith grief--that\\'s beauty\\'s canker--thou might\\'st\\ncall him\\nA goodly person. He hath lost his fellows\\nAnd strays about to find \\'em.\\n\\nMIRANDA  I might call him\\nA thing divine, for nothing natural\\nI ever saw so noble.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  It goes on, I see,\\nAs my soul prompts it. [To Ariel.] Spirit, fine spirit,\\nI\\'ll free thee\\nWithin two days for this.\\n\\nFERDINAND, [seeing Miranda]  Most sure, the goddess\\nOn whom these airs attend!--Vouchsafe my prayer\\nMay know if you remain upon this island,\\nAnd that you will some good instruction give\\nHow I may bear me here. My prime request,\\nWhich I do last pronounce, is--O you wonder!--\\nIf you be maid or no.\\n\\nMIRANDA  No wonder, sir,\\nBut certainly a maid.\\n\\nFERDINAND  My language! Heavens!\\nI am the best of them that speak this speech,\\nWere I but where \\'tis spoken.\\n\\nPROSPERO  How? The best?\\nWhat wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nA single thing, as I am now, that wonders\\nTo hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,\\nAnd that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,\\nWho with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld\\nThe King my father wracked.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Alack, for mercy!\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nYes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan\\nAnd his brave son being twain.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  The Duke of Milan\\nAnd his more braver daughter could control thee,\\nIf now \\'twere fit to do \\'t. At the first sight\\nThey have changed eyes.--Delicate Ariel,\\nI\\'ll set thee free for this. [To Ferdinand.] A word,\\ngood sir.\\nI fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nWhy speaks my father so ungently? This\\nIs the third man that e\\'er I saw, the first\\nThat e\\'er I sighed for. Pity move my father\\nTo be inclined my way.\\n\\nFERDINAND  O, if a virgin,\\nAnd your affection not gone forth, I\\'ll make you\\nThe Queen of Naples.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Soft, sir, one word more.\\n[Aside.] They are both in either\\'s powers. But this\\nswift business\\nI must uneasy make, lest too light winning\\nMake the prize light. [To Ferdinand.] One word\\nmore. I charge thee\\nThat thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp\\nThe name thou ow\\'st not, and hast put thyself\\nUpon this island as a spy, to win it\\nFrom me, the lord on \\'t.\\n\\nFERDINAND  No, as I am a man!\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nThere\\'s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.\\nIf the ill spirit have so fair a house,\\nGood things will strive to dwell with \\'t.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]  Follow me.\\n[To Miranda.] Speak not you for him. He\\'s a traitor.\\n[To Ferdinand.] Come,\\nI\\'ll manacle thy neck and feet together.\\nSea water shalt thou drink. Thy food shall be\\nThe fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks\\nWherein the acorn cradled. Follow.\\n\\nFERDINAND  No,\\nI will resist such entertainment till\\nMine enemy has more power.\\n[He draws, and is charmed from moving.]\\n\\nMIRANDA  O dear father,\\nMake not too rash a trial of him, for\\nHe\\'s gentle and not fearful.\\n\\nPROSPERO  What, I say,\\nMy foot my tutor?--Put thy sword up, traitor,\\nWho mak\\'st a show, but dar\\'st not strike, thy\\nconscience\\nIs so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward,\\nFor I can here disarm thee with this stick\\nAnd make thy weapon drop.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Beseech you, father--\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nHence! Hang not on my garments.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Sir, have pity.\\nI\\'ll be his surety.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Silence! One word more\\nShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What,\\nAn advocate for an impostor? Hush.\\nThou think\\'st there is no more such shapes as he,\\nHaving seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench,\\nTo th\\' most of men this is a Caliban,\\nAnd they to him are angels.\\n\\nMIRANDA  My affections\\nAre then most humble. I have no ambition\\nTo see a goodlier man.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]  Come on, obey.\\nThy nerves are in their infancy again\\nAnd have no vigor in them.\\n\\nFERDINAND  So they are.\\nMy spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.\\nMy father\\'s loss, the weakness which I feel,\\nThe wrack of all my friends, nor this man\\'s threats\\nTo whom I am subdued, are but light to me,\\nMight I but through my prison once a day\\nBehold this maid. All corners else o\\' th\\' Earth\\nLet liberty make use of. Space enough\\nHave I in such a prison.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  It works.--Come on.--\\nThou hast done well, fine Ariel.--Follow me.\\n[To Ariel.] Hark what thou else shalt do me.\\n\\nMIRANDA, [to Ferdinand]  Be of\\ncomfort.\\nMy father\\'s of a better nature, sir,\\nThan he appears by speech. This is unwonted\\nWhich now came from him.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Ariel]  Thou shalt be as free\\nAs mountain winds; but then exactly do\\nAll points of my command.\\n\\nARIEL  To th\\' syllable.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]\\nCome follow. [To Miranda.] Speak not for him.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n\\nACT 2\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,\\nFrancisco, and others.]\\n\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]\\nBeseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause--\\nSo have we all--of joy, for our escape\\nIs much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe\\nIs common; every day some sailor\\'s wife,\\nThe masters of some merchant, and the merchant\\nHave just our theme of woe. But for the miracle--\\nI mean our preservation--few in millions\\nCan speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh\\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\\n\\nALONSO  Prithee, peace.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  He receives comfort like\\ncold porridge.\\n\\nANTONIO  The visitor will not give him o\\'er so.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Look, he\\'s winding up the watch of his wit.\\nBy and by it will strike.\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]  Sir--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  One. Tell.\\n\\nGONZALO  When every grief is entertained that\\'s offered,\\ncomes to th\\' entertainer--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  A dollar.\\n\\nGONZALO  Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken\\ntruer than you purposed.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  You have taken it wiselier than I meant you\\nshould.\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]  Therefore, my lord--\\n\\nANTONIO  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.\\n\\nALONSO, [to Gonzalo]  I prithee, spare.\\n\\nGONZALO  Well, I have done. But yet--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  He will be talking.\\n\\nANTONIO, [aside to Sebastian]  Which, of he or Adrian,\\nfor a good wager, first begins to crow?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  The old cock.\\n\\nANTONIO  The cockerel.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Done. The wager?\\n\\nANTONIO  A laughter.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  A match!\\n\\nADRIAN  Though this island seem to be desert--\\n\\nANTONIO  Ha, ha, ha.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  So. You\\'re paid.\\n\\nADRIAN  Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Yet--\\n\\nADRIAN  Yet--\\n\\nANTONIO  He could not miss \\'t.\\n\\nADRIAN  It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate\\ntemperance.\\n\\nANTONIO  Temperance was a delicate wench.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly\\ndelivered.\\n\\nADRIAN  The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.\\n\\nANTONIO  Or as \\'twere perfumed by a fen.\\n\\nGONZALO  Here is everything advantageous to life.\\n\\nANTONIO  True, save means to live.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Of that there\\'s none, or little.\\n\\nGONZALO  How lush and lusty the grass looks! How\\ngreen!\\n\\nANTONIO  The ground indeed is tawny.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  With an eye of green in \\'t.\\n\\nANTONIO  He misses not much.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.\\n\\nGONZALO  But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost\\nbeyond credit--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  As many vouched rarities are.\\n\\nGONZALO  That our garments, being, as they were,\\ndrenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their\\nfreshness and gloss, being rather new-dyed than\\nstained with salt water.\\n\\nANTONIO  If but one of his pockets could speak, would\\nit not say he lies?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.\\n\\nGONZALO  Methinks our garments are now as fresh as\\nwhen we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage\\nof the King\\'s fair daughter Claribel to the King of\\nTunis.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  \\'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper\\nwell in our return.\\n\\nADRIAN  Tunis was never graced before with such a\\nparagon to their queen.\\n\\nGONZALO  Not since widow Dido\\'s time.\\n\\nANTONIO  Widow? A pox o\\' that! How came that \"widow\"\\nin? Widow Dido!\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  What if he had said \"widower Aeneas\" too?\\nGood Lord, how you take it!\\n\\nADRIAN, [to Gonzalo]  \"Widow Dido,\" said you? You\\nmake me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of\\nTunis.\\n\\nGONZALO  This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\\n\\nADRIAN  Carthage?\\n\\nGONZALO  I assure you, Carthage.\\n\\nANTONIO  His word is more than the miraculous harp.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  He hath raised the wall, and houses too.\\n\\nANTONIO  What impossible matter will he make easy\\nnext?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  I think he will carry this island home in his\\npocket and give it his son for an apple.\\n\\nANTONIO  And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring\\nforth more islands.\\n\\nGONZALO  Ay.\\n\\nANTONIO  Why, in good time.\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]  Sir, we were talking that our\\ngarments seem now as fresh as when we were at\\nTunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now\\nqueen.\\n\\nANTONIO  And the rarest that e\\'er came there.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\\n\\nANTONIO  O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]  Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as\\nthe first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.\\n\\nANTONIO  That \"sort\" was well fished for.\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]  When I wore it at your daughter\\'s\\nmarriage.\\n\\nALONSO\\nYou cram these words into mine ears against\\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\\nMarried my daughter there, for coming thence\\nMy son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,\\nWho is so far from Italy removed\\nI ne\\'er again shall see her.--O, thou mine heir\\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\\nHath made his meal on thee?\\n\\nFRANCISCO  Sir, he may live.\\nI saw him beat the surges under him\\nAnd ride upon their backs. He trod the water,\\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\\nThe surge most swoll\\'n that met him. His bold head\\n\\'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared\\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\\nTo th\\' shore, that o\\'er his wave-worn basis bowed,\\nAs stooping to relieve him. I not doubt\\nHe came alive to land.\\n\\nALONSO  No, no, he\\'s gone.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN\\nSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\\nBut rather lose her to an African,\\nWhere she at least is banished from your eye,\\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on \\'t.\\n\\nALONSO  Prithee, peace.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN\\nYou were kneeled to and importuned otherwise\\nBy all of us; and the fair soul herself\\nWeighed between loathness and obedience at\\nWhich end o\\' th\\' beam should bow. We have lost\\nyour son,\\nI fear, forever. Milan and Naples have\\nMore widows in them of this business\\' making\\nThan we bring men to comfort them.\\nThe fault\\'s your own.\\n\\nALONSO  So is the dear\\'st o\\' th\\' loss.\\n\\nGONZALO  My lord Sebastian,\\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\\nAnd time to speak it in. You rub the sore\\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Very well.\\n\\nANTONIO  And most chirurgeonly.\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]\\nIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,\\nWhen you are cloudy.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Foul weather?\\n\\nANTONIO  Very foul.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nHad I plantation of this isle, my lord--\\n\\nANTONIO\\nHe\\'d sow \\'t with nettle seed.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Or docks, or mallows.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nAnd were the king on \\'t, what would I do?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Scape being drunk, for want of wine.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nI\\' th\\' commonwealth I would by contraries\\nExecute all things, for no kind of traffic\\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,\\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\\nNo occupation; all men idle, all,\\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\\nNo sovereignty--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Yet he would be king on \\'t.\\n\\nANTONIO  The latter end of his commonwealth forgets\\nthe beginning.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nAll things in common nature should produce\\nWithout sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,\\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine\\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth\\nOf its own kind all foison, all abundance,\\nTo feed my innocent people.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  No marrying \\'mong his subjects?\\n\\nANTONIO  None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nI would with such perfection govern, sir,\\nT\\' excel the Golden Age.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  \\'Save his Majesty!\\n\\nANTONIO\\nLong live Gonzalo!\\n\\nGONZALO  And do you mark me, sir?\\n\\nALONSO\\nPrithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.\\n\\nGONZALO  I do well believe your Highness, and did it to\\nminister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of\\nsuch sensible and nimble lungs that they always use\\nto laugh at nothing.\\n\\nANTONIO  \\'Twas you we laughed at.\\n\\nGONZALO  Who in this kind of merry fooling am\\nnothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at\\nnothing still.\\n\\nANTONIO  What a blow was there given!\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  An it had not fallen flatlong.\\n\\nGONZALO  You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You\\nwould lift the moon out of her sphere if she would\\ncontinue in it five weeks without changing.\\n\\n[Enter Ariel invisible, playing solemn music.]\\n\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  We would so, and then go a-batfowling.\\n\\nANTONIO, [to Gonzalo]  Nay, good my lord, be not angry.\\n\\nGONZALO  No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my\\ndiscretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep?\\nFor I am very heavy.\\n\\nANTONIO  Go sleep, and hear us.\\n[All sink down asleep except Alonso,\\nAntonio, and Sebastian.]\\n\\nALONSO\\nWhat, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes\\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find\\nThey are inclined to do so.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Please you, sir,\\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it.\\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\\nIt is a comforter.\\n\\nANTONIO  We two, my lord,\\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\\nAnd watch your safety.\\n\\nALONSO  Thank you. Wondrous heavy.\\n[Alonso sleeps. Ariel exits.]\\n\\nSEBASTIAN\\nWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!\\n\\nANTONIO\\nIt is the quality o\\' th\\' climate.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Why\\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find\\nNot myself disposed to sleep.\\n\\nANTONIO  Nor I. My spirits are nimble.\\nThey fell together all, as by consent.\\nThey dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,\\nWorthy Sebastian, O, what might--? No more.\\nAnd yet methinks I see it in thy face\\nWhat thou shouldst be. Th\\' occasion speaks thee, and\\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\\nDropping upon thy head.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  What, art thou waking?\\n\\nANTONIO\\nDo you not hear me speak?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  I do, and surely\\nIt is a sleepy language, and thou speak\\'st\\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\\nWith eyes wide open--standing, speaking, moving--\\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\\n\\nANTONIO  Noble Sebastian,\\nThou let\\'st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink\\'st\\nWhiles thou art waking.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Thou dost snore distinctly.\\nThere\\'s meaning in thy snores.\\n\\nANTONIO\\nI am more serious than my custom. You\\nMust be so too, if heed me; which to do\\nTrebles thee o\\'er.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Well, I am standing water.\\n\\nANTONIO\\nI\\'ll teach you how to flow.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Do so. To ebb\\nHereditary sloth instructs me.\\n\\nANTONIO  O,\\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\\nWhiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it\\nYou more invest it. Ebbing men indeed\\nMost often do so near the bottom run\\nBy their own fear or sloth.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Prithee, say on.\\nThe setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim\\nA matter from thee, and a birth indeed\\nWhich throes thee much to yield.\\n\\nANTONIO  Thus, sir:\\nAlthough this lord of weak remembrance--this,\\nWho shall be of as little memory\\nWhen he is earthed--hath here almost persuaded--\\nFor he\\'s a spirit of persuasion, only\\nProfesses to persuade--the King his son\\'s alive,\\n\\'Tis as impossible that he\\'s undrowned\\nAs he that sleeps here swims.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  I have no hope\\nThat he\\'s undrowned.\\n\\nANTONIO  O, out of that no hope\\nWhat great hope have you! No hope that way is\\nAnother way so high a hope that even\\nAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\\nBut doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me\\nThat Ferdinand is drowned?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  He\\'s gone.\\n\\nANTONIO  Then tell me,\\nWho\\'s the next heir of Naples?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Claribel.\\n\\nANTONIO\\nShe that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells\\nTen leagues beyond man\\'s life; she that from Naples\\nCan have no note, unless the sun were post--\\nThe man i\\' th\\' moon\\'s too slow--till newborn chins\\nBe rough and razorable; she that from whom\\nWe all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,\\nAnd by that destiny to perform an act\\nWhereof what\\'s past is prologue, what to come\\nIn yours and my discharge.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  What stuff is this? How say you?\\n\\'Tis true my brother\\'s daughter\\'s Queen of Tunis,\\nSo is she heir of Naples, \\'twixt which regions\\nThere is some space.\\n\\nANTONIO  A space whose ev\\'ry cubit\\nSeems to cry out \"How shall that Claribel\\nMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis\\nAnd let Sebastian wake.\" Say this were death\\nThat now hath seized them, why, they were no worse\\nThan now they are. There be that can rule Naples\\nAs well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate\\nAs amply and unnecessarily\\nAs this Gonzalo. I myself could make\\nA chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\\nThe mind that I do, what a sleep were this\\nFor your advancement! Do you understand me?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN\\nMethinks I do.\\n\\nANTONIO  And how does your content\\nTender your own good fortune?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  I remember\\nYou did supplant your brother Prospero.\\n\\nANTONIO  True,\\nAnd look how well my garments sit upon me,\\nMuch feater than before. My brother\\'s servants\\nWere then my fellows; now they are my men.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  But, for your conscience?\\n\\nANTONIO\\nAy, sir, where lies that? If \\'twere a kibe,\\n\\'Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not\\nThis deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences\\nThat stand \\'twixt me and Milan, candied be they\\nAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\\nNo better than the earth he lies upon.\\nIf he were that which now he\\'s like--that\\'s dead--\\nWhom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\\nCan lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,\\nTo the perpetual wink for aye might put\\nThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\\nShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\\nThey\\'ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\\nThey\\'ll tell the clock to any business that\\nWe say befits the hour.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Thy case, dear friend,\\nShall be my precedent: as thou got\\'st Milan,\\nI\\'ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke\\nShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,\\nAnd I the King shall love thee.\\n\\nANTONIO  Draw together,\\nAnd when I rear my hand, do you the like\\nTo fall it on Gonzalo.\\t[They draw their swords.]\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  O, but one word.\\n[They talk apart.]\\n\\n[Enter Ariel, invisible, with music and song.]\\n\\n\\nARIEL, [to the sleeping Gonzalo]\\nMy master through his art foresees the danger\\nThat you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth--\\nFor else his project dies--to keep them living.\\n[Sings in Gonzalo\\'s ear:]\\n\\tWhile you here do snoring lie,\\n\\tOpen-eyed conspiracy\\n\\t   His time doth take.\\n\\tIf of life you keep a care,\\n\\tShake off slumber and beware.\\n\\t   Awake, awake!\\n\\nANTONIO, [to Sebastian]  Then let us both be sudden.\\n\\nGONZALO, [waking]  Now, good angels preserve the\\nKing!\\t[He wakes Alonso.]\\n\\nALONSO, [to Sebastian]\\nWhy, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn?\\nWherefore this ghastly looking?\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Sebastian]  What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN\\nWhiles we stood here securing your repose,\\nEven now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing\\nLike bulls, or rather lions. Did \\'t not wake you?\\nIt struck mine ear most terribly.\\n\\nALONSO  I heard nothing.\\n\\nANTONIO\\nO, \\'twas a din to fright a monster\\'s ear,\\nTo make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar\\nOf a whole herd of lions.\\n\\nALONSO  Heard you this, Gonzalo?\\n\\nGONZALO\\nUpon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming,\\nAnd that a strange one too, which did awake me.\\nI shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened,\\nI saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,\\nThat\\'s verily. \\'Tis best we stand upon our guard,\\nOr that we quit this place. Let\\'s draw our weapons.\\n\\nALONSO\\nLead off this ground, and let\\'s make further search\\nFor my poor son.\\n\\nGONZALO  Heavens keep him from these beasts,\\nFor he is, sure, i\\' th\\' island.\\n\\nALONSO  Lead away.\\n\\nARIEL, [aside]\\nProspero my lord shall know what I have done.\\nSo, king, go safely on to seek thy son.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of\\nthunder heard.]\\n\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nAll the infections that the sun sucks up\\nFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him\\nBy inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me,\\nAnd yet I needs must curse. But they\\'ll nor pinch,\\nFright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i\\' th\\' mire,\\nNor lead me like a firebrand in the dark\\nOut of my way, unless he bid \\'em. But\\nFor every trifle are they set upon me,\\nSometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me\\nAnd after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which\\nLie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount\\nTheir pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I\\nAll wound with adders, who with cloven tongues\\nDo hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo!\\nHere comes a spirit of his, and to torment me\\nFor bringing wood in slowly. I\\'ll fall flat.\\nPerchance he will not mind me.\\n[He lies down and covers himself with a cloak.]\\n\\n[Enter Trinculo.]\\n\\n\\nTRINCULO  Here\\'s neither bush nor shrub to bear off\\nany weather at all. And another storm brewing; I\\nhear it sing i\\' th\\' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond\\nhuge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed\\nhis liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I\\nknow not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud\\ncannot choose but fall by pailfuls. [Noticing Caliban.]\\nWhat have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or\\nalive? A fish, he smells like a fish--a very ancient\\nand fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John.\\nA strange fish. Were I in England now, as once\\nI was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday\\nfool there but would give a piece of silver. There\\nwould this monster make a man. Any strange beast\\nthere makes a man. When they will not give a doit to\\nrelieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a\\ndead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like\\narms! Warm, o\\' my troth! I do now let loose my\\nopinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an\\nislander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.\\n[Thunder.] Alas, the storm is come again. My best\\nway is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no\\nother shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man\\nwith strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the\\ndregs of the storm be past.\\n[He crawls under Caliban\\'s cloak.]\\n\\n[Enter Stephano singing.]\\n\\n\\nSTEPHANO\\n\\tI shall no more to sea, to sea.\\n\\tHere shall I die ashore--\\nThis is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man\\'s funeral.\\nWell, here\\'s my comfort.\\t[Drinks.]\\n[Sings.]\\n\\n\\tThe master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\\n\\t   The gunner and his mate,\\n\\tLoved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\\n\\t   But none of us cared for Kate.\\n\\t      For she had a tongue with a tang,\\n\\t      Would cry to a sailor \"Go hang!\"\\n\\tShe loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch,\\n\\tYet a tailor might scratch her where\\'er she did itch.\\n\\t      Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!\\nThis is a scurvy tune too. But here\\'s my comfort.\\n[Drinks.]\\n\\nCALIBAN  Do not torment me! O!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  What\\'s the matter? Have we devils here? Do\\nyou put tricks upon \\'s with savages and men of Ind?\\nHa? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now\\nof your four legs, for it hath been said \"As proper a\\nman as ever went on four legs cannot make him\\ngive ground,\" and it shall be said so again while\\nStephano breathes at\\' nostrils.\\n\\nCALIBAN  The spirit torments me. O!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  This is some monster of the isle with four\\nlegs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the\\ndevil should he learn our language? I will give him\\nsome relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him\\nand keep him tame and get to Naples with him,\\nhe\\'s a present for any emperor that ever trod on\\nneat\\'s leather.\\n\\nCALIBAN  Do not torment me, prithee. I\\'ll bring my\\nwood home faster.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  He\\'s in his fit now, and does not talk after\\nthe wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have\\nnever drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove\\nhis fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will\\nnot take too much for him. He shall pay for him that\\nhath him, and that soundly.\\n\\nCALIBAN  Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt\\nanon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper\\nworks upon thee.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Come on your ways. Open your mouth.\\nHere is that which will give language to you, cat.\\nOpen your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I\\ncan tell you, and that soundly. [Caliban drinks.] You\\ncannot tell who\\'s your friend. Open your chaps\\nagain.\\n\\nTRINCULO  I should know that voice. It should be--but\\nhe is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Four legs and two voices--a most delicate\\nmonster! His forward voice now is to speak well of\\nhis friend. His backward voice is to utter foul\\nspeeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle\\nwill recover him, I will help his ague. Come.\\n[Caliban drinks.] Amen! I will pour some in thy\\nother mouth.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Stephano!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy,\\nthis is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I\\nhave no long spoon.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Stephano! If thou be\\'st Stephano, touch me\\nand speak to me, for I am Trinculo--be not\\nafeard--thy good friend Trinculo.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  If thou be\\'st Trinculo, come forth. I\\'ll pull\\nthee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo\\'s legs,\\nthese are they. [He pulls him out from under Caliban\\'s\\ncloak.] Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How\\ncam\\'st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can\\nhe vent Trinculos?\\n\\nTRINCULO  I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.\\nBut art thou not drowned, Stephano? I\\nhope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm\\noverblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf\\'s\\ngaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living,\\nStephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach\\nis not constant.\\n\\nCALIBAN, [aside]  These be fine things, an if they be not\\nsprites. That\\'s a brave god and bears celestial liquor.\\nI will kneel to him.\\n[He crawls out from under the cloak.]\\n\\nSTEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  How didst thou scape? How\\ncam\\'st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou\\ncam\\'st hither--I escaped upon a butt of sack, which\\nthe sailors heaved o\\'erboard--by this bottle, which\\nI made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands,\\nsince I was cast ashore.\\n\\nCALIBAN  I\\'ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true\\nsubject, for the liquor is not earthly.\\n\\nSTEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  Here. Swear then how thou\\nescapedst.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim\\nlike a duck, I\\'ll be sworn.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Here, kiss the book.\\t[Trinculo drinks.]\\nThough thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made\\nlike a goose.\\n\\nTRINCULO  O Stephano, hast any more of this?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock\\nby th\\' seaside, where my wine is hid.--How now,\\nmooncalf, how does thine ague?\\n\\nCALIBAN  Hast thou not dropped from heaven?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Out o\\' th\\' moon, I do assure thee. I was the\\nman i\\' th\\' moon when time was.\\n\\nCALIBAN  I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.\\nMy mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy\\nbush.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will\\nfurnish it anon with new contents. Swear.\\n[Caliban drinks.]\\n\\nTRINCULO  By this good light, this is a very shallow\\nmonster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The\\nman i\\' th\\' moon? A most poor, credulous monster!\\n--Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!\\n\\nCALIBAN  I\\'ll show thee every fertile inch o\\' th\\' island,\\nand I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.\\n\\nTRINCULO  By this light, a most perfidious and drunken\\nmonster. When \\'s god\\'s asleep, he\\'ll rob his bottle.\\n\\nCALIBAN  I\\'ll kiss thy foot. I\\'ll swear myself thy subject.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Come on, then. Down, and swear.\\n[Caliban kneels.]\\n\\nTRINCULO  I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed\\nmonster. A most scurvy monster. I could\\nfind in my heart to beat him--\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Come, kiss.\\n\\nTRINCULO  --but that the poor monster\\'s in drink. An\\nabominable monster.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nI\\'ll show thee the best springs. I\\'ll pluck thee berries.\\nI\\'ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.\\nA plague upon the tyrant that I serve.\\nI\\'ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\\nThou wondrous man.\\n\\nTRINCULO  A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder\\nof a poor drunkard.\\n\\nCALIBAN, [standing]\\nI prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,\\nAnd I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,\\nShow thee a jay\\'s nest, and instruct thee how\\nTo snare the nimble marmoset. I\\'ll bring thee\\nTo clustering filberts, and sometimes I\\'ll get thee\\nYoung scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  I prithee now, lead the way without any\\nmore talking.--Trinculo, the King and all our\\ncompany else being drowned, we will inherit here.\\n--Here, bear my bottle.--Fellow Trinculo, we\\'ll\\nfill him by and by again.\\n\\nCALIBAN [sings drunkenly]\\n\\tFarewell, master, farewell, farewell.\\n\\nTRINCULO  A howling monster, a drunken monster.\\n\\nCALIBAN [sings]\\n\\tNo more dams I\\'ll make for fish,\\n\\t   Nor fetch in firing\\n\\t   At requiring,\\n\\tNor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.\\n\\t   \\'Ban, \\'ban, Ca-caliban\\n\\t   Has a new master.

Lead the way.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n\\nACT 3\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.]\\n\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nThere be some sports are painful, and their labor\\nDelight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness\\nAre nobly undergone; and most poor matters\\nPoint to rich ends. This my mean task\\nWould be as heavy to me as odious, but\\nThe mistress which I serve quickens what\\'s dead\\nAnd makes my labors pleasures. O, she is\\nTen times more gentle than her father\\'s crabbed,\\nAnd he\\'s composed of harshness. I must remove\\nSome thousands of these logs and pile them up,\\nUpon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress\\nWeeps when she sees me work, and says such\\nbaseness\\nHad never like executor. I forget;\\nBut these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors,\\nMost busiest when I do it.\\n\\n[Enter Miranda; and Prospero at a distance, unobserved.]\\n\\n\\nMIRANDA  Alas now, pray you,\\nWork not so hard. I would the lightning had\\nBurnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile.\\nPray, set it down and rest you. When this burns\\n\\'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father\\nIs hard at study. Pray now, rest yourself.\\nHe\\'s safe for these three hours.\\n\\nFERDINAND  O most dear mistress,\\nThe sun will set before I shall discharge\\nWhat I must strive to do.\\n\\nMIRANDA  If you\\'ll sit down,\\nI\\'ll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that.\\nI\\'ll carry it to the pile.\\n\\nFERDINAND  No, precious creature,\\nI had rather crack my sinews, break my back,\\nThan you should such dishonor undergo\\nWhile I sit lazy by.\\n\\nMIRANDA  It would become me\\nAs well as it does you, and I should do it\\nWith much more ease, for my good will is to it,\\nAnd yours it is against.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  Poor worm, thou art infected.\\nThis visitation shows it.\\n\\nMIRANDA  You look wearily.\\nFERDINAND\\nNo, noble mistress, \\'tis fresh morning with me\\nWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you,\\nChiefly that I might set it in my prayers,\\nWhat is your name?\\n\\nMIRANDA  Miranda.--O my father,\\nI have broke your hest to say so!\\n\\nFERDINAND  Admired Miranda!\\nIndeed the top of admiration, worth\\nWhat\\'s dearest to the world! Full many a lady\\nI have eyed with best regard, and many a time\\nTh\\' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\\nBrought my too diligent ear. For several virtues\\nHave I liked several women, never any\\nWith so full soul but some defect in her\\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,\\nAnd put it to the foil. But you, O you,\\nSo perfect and so peerless, are created\\nOf every creature\\'s best.\\n\\nMIRANDA  I do not know\\nOne of my sex, no woman\\'s face remember,\\nSave, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen\\nMore that I may call men than you, good friend,\\nAnd my dear father. How features are abroad\\nI am skilless of, but by my modesty,\\nThe jewel in my dower, I would not wish\\nAny companion in the world but you,\\nNor can imagination form a shape\\nBesides yourself to like of. But I prattle\\nSomething too wildly, and my father\\'s precepts\\nI therein do forget.\\n\\nFERDINAND  I am in my condition\\nA prince, Miranda; I do think a king--\\nI would, not so!--and would no more endure\\nThis wooden slavery than to suffer\\nThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\\nThe very instant that I saw you did\\nMy heart fly to your service, there resides\\nTo make me slave to it, and for your sake\\nAm I this patient log-man.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Do you love me?\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nO heaven, O Earth, bear witness to this sound,\\nAnd crown what I profess with kind event\\nIf I speak true; if hollowly, invert\\nWhat best is boded me to mischief. I,\\nBeyond all limit of what else i\\' th\\' world,\\nDo love, prize, honor you.\\n\\nMIRANDA  I am a fool\\nTo weep at what I am glad of.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  Fair encounter\\nOf two most rare affections. Heavens rain grace\\nOn that which breeds between \\'em!\\n\\nFERDINAND  Wherefore\\nweep you?\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nAt mine unworthiness, that dare not offer\\nWhat I desire to give, and much less take\\nWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling,\\nAnd all the more it seeks to hide itself,\\nThe bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,\\nAnd prompt me, plain and holy innocence.\\nI am your wife if you will marry me.\\nIf not, I\\'ll die your maid. To be your fellow\\nYou may deny me, but I\\'ll be your servant\\nWhether you will or no.\\n\\nFERDINAND\\nMy mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nMy husband, then?\\n\\nFERDINAND  Ay, with a heart as willing\\nAs bondage e\\'er of freedom. Here\\'s my hand.\\n\\nMIRANDA, [clasping his hand]\\nAnd mine, with my heart in \\'t. And now farewell\\nTill half an hour hence.\\n\\nFERDINAND  A thousand thousand.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nSo glad of this as they I cannot be,\\nWho are surprised withal; but my rejoicing\\nAt nothing can be more. I\\'ll to my book,\\nFor yet ere suppertime must I perform\\nMuch business appertaining.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.]\\n\\n\\nSTEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  Tell not me. When the butt is\\nout, we will drink water; not a drop before. Therefore\\nbear up and board \\'em.--Servant monster,\\ndrink to me.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Servant monster? The folly of this island!\\nThey say there\\'s but five upon this isle; we are three\\nof them. If th\\' other two be brained like us, the state\\ntotters.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee.\\nThy eyes are almost set in thy head.\\n[Caliban drinks.]\\n\\nTRINCULO  Where should they be set else? He were a\\nbrave monster indeed if they were set in his tail.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  My man-monster hath drowned his tongue\\nin sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me. I\\nswam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty\\nleagues off and on, by this light.--Thou shalt be my\\nlieutenant, monster, or my standard.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Your lieutenant, if you list. He\\'s no\\nstandard.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  We\\'ll not run, Monsieur Monster.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Nor go neither. But you\\'ll lie like dogs, and\\nyet say nothing neither.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou\\nbe\\'st a good mooncalf.\\n\\nCALIBAN  How does thy Honor? Let me lick thy shoe. I\\'ll\\nnot serve him; he is not valiant.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Thou liest, most ignorant monster. I am in\\ncase to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched\\nfish, thou! Was there ever man a coward that hath\\ndrunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a\\nmonstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a\\nmonster?\\n\\nCALIBAN  Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my\\nlord?\\n\\nTRINCULO  \"Lord,\" quoth he? That a monster should be\\nsuch a natural!\\n\\nCALIBAN  Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.\\nIf you prove a mutineer, the next tree. The poor\\nmonster\\'s my subject, and he shall not suffer\\nindignity.\\n\\nCALIBAN  I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased\\nto harken once again to the suit I made to thee?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will\\nstand, and so shall Trinculo.\\n\\n[Enter Ariel, invisible.]\\n\\n\\nCALIBAN, [kneeling]  As I told thee before, I am subject\\nto a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath\\ncheated me of the island.\\n\\nARIEL, [in Trinculo\\'s voice]  Thou liest.\\n\\nCALIBAN, [to Trinculo]  Thou liest, thou jesting monkey,\\nthou. [He stands.] I would my valiant master would\\ndestroy thee. I do not lie.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in \\'s\\ntale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your\\nteeth.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Why, I said nothing.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Mum then, and no more. [Trinculo stands\\naside.] Proceed.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nI say by sorcery he got this isle;\\nFrom me he got it. If thy Greatness will,\\nRevenge it on him, for I know thou dar\\'st,\\nBut this thing dare not.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  That\\'s most certain.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nThou shalt be lord of it, and I\\'ll serve thee.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  How now shall this be compassed? Canst\\nthou bring me to the party?\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nYea, yea, my lord. I\\'ll yield him thee asleep,\\nWhere thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\\n\\nARIEL, [in Trinculo\\'s voice]  Thou liest. Thou canst not.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nWhat a pied ninny\\'s this!--Thou scurvy patch!--\\nI do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows\\nAnd take his bottle from him. When that\\'s gone,\\nHe shall drink naught but brine, for I\\'ll not show him\\nWhere the quick freshes are.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt\\nthe monster one word further, and by this\\nhand, I\\'ll turn my mercy out o\\' doors and make a\\nstockfish of thee.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Why, what did I? I did nothing. I\\'ll go\\nfarther off.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Didst thou not say he lied?\\n\\nARIEL, [in Trinculo\\'s voice]  Thou liest.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Do I so? Take thou that.\\t[He beats Trinculo.]\\nAs you like this, give me the lie another time.\\n\\nTRINCULO  I did not give the lie! Out o\\' your wits and\\nhearing too? A pox o\\' your bottle! This can sack and\\ndrinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the\\ndevil take your fingers!\\n\\nCALIBAN  Ha, ha, ha!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Now forward with your tale. [To Trinculo.]\\nPrithee, stand further off.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nBeat him enough. After a little time\\nI\\'ll beat him too.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Stand farther. [Trinculo moves farther\\naway.] Come, proceed.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nWhy, as I told thee, \\'tis a custom with him\\nI\\' th\\' afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,\\nHaving first seized his books, or with a log\\nBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\\nOr cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember\\nFirst to possess his books, for without them\\nHe\\'s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\\nOne spirit to command. They all do hate him\\nAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\\nHe has brave utensils--for so he calls them--\\nWhich, when he has a house, he\\'ll deck withal.\\nAnd that most deeply to consider is\\nThe beauty of his daughter. He himself\\nCalls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman\\nBut only Sycorax my dam and she;\\nBut she as far surpasseth Sycorax\\nAs great\\'st does least.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Is it so brave a lass?\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nAy, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,\\nAnd bring thee forth brave brood.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter\\nand I will be king and queen--save our Graces!--\\nand Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.--Dost\\nthou like the plot, Trinculo?\\n\\nTRINCULO  Excellent.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee.\\nBut while thou liv\\'st, keep a good tongue in thy\\nhead.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nWithin this half hour will he be asleep.\\nWilt thou destroy him then?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Ay, on mine honor.\\n\\nARIEL, [aside]  This will I tell my master.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nThou mak\\'st me merry. I am full of pleasure.\\nLet us be jocund. Will you troll the catch\\nYou taught me but whilere?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  At thy request, monster, I will do reason,\\nany reason.--Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.\\n[Sings.]\\n\\tFlout \\'em and cout \\'em\\n\\tAnd scout \\'em and flout \\'em!\\n\\t   Thought is free.\\n\\nCALIBAN  That\\'s not the tune.\\n[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.]\\n\\nSTEPHANO  What is this same?\\n\\nTRINCULO  This is the tune of our catch played by the\\npicture of Nobody.\\n\\nSTEPHANO, [to the invisible musician]  If thou be\\'st a\\nman, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou be\\'st a\\ndevil, take \\'t as thou list.\\n\\nTRINCULO  O, forgive me my sins!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  He that dies pays all debts.--I defy thee!--\\nMercy upon us!\\n\\nCALIBAN  Art thou afeard?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  No, monster, not I.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nBe not afeard. The isle is full of noises,\\nSounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.\\nSometimes a thousand twangling instruments\\nWill hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices\\nThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,\\nWill make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,\\nThe clouds methought would open, and show riches\\nReady to drop upon me, that when I waked\\nI cried to dream again.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  This will prove a brave kingdom to me,\\nwhere I shall have my music for nothing.\\n\\nCALIBAN  When Prospero is destroyed.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  That shall be by and by. I remember the\\nstory.\\n\\nTRINCULO  The sound is going away. Let\\'s follow it, and\\nafter do our work.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Lead, monster. We\\'ll follow.--I would I\\ncould see this taborer. He lays it on. Wilt come?\\n\\nTRINCULO  I\\'ll follow, Stephano.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,\\nFrancisco, etc.]\\n\\n\\nGONZALO\\nBy \\'r lakin, I can go no further, sir.\\nMy old bones aches. Here\\'s a maze trod indeed\\nThrough forthrights and meanders. By your\\npatience,\\nI needs must rest me.\\n\\nALONSO  Old lord, I cannot blame thee.\\nWho am myself attached with weariness\\nTo th\\' dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.\\nEven here I will put off my hope and keep it\\nNo longer for my flatterer. He is drowned\\nWhom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks\\nOur frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.\\n\\nANTONIO, [aside to Sebastian]\\nI am right glad that he\\'s so out of hope.\\nDo not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose\\nThat you resolved t\\' effect.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  The next advantage\\nWill we take throughly.\\n\\nANTONIO, [aside to Sebastian]  Let it be tonight;\\nFor now they are oppressed with travel, they\\nWill not nor cannot use such vigilance\\nAs when they are fresh.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  I say tonight. No more.\\n\\n[Solemn and strange music, and enter Prospero on the\\ntop invisible.]\\n\\n\\nALONSO\\nWhat harmony is this? My good friends, hark.\\n\\nGONZALO  Marvelous sweet music!\\n\\n[Enter several strange shapes, bringing in a banquet, and\\ndance about it with gentle actions of salutations.]\\n\\n\\nALONSO\\nGive us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN\\nA living drollery! Now I will believe\\nThat there are unicorns, that in Arabia\\nThere is one tree, the phoenix\\' throne, one phoenix\\nAt this hour reigning there.\\n\\nANTONIO  I\\'ll believe both;\\nAnd what does else want credit, come to me\\nAnd I\\'ll be sworn \\'tis true. Travelers ne\\'er did lie,\\nThough fools at home condemn \\'em.\\n\\nGONZALO  If in Naples\\nI should report this now, would they believe me?\\nIf I should say I saw such islanders--\\nFor, certes, these are people of the island--\\nWho, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note\\nTheir manners are more gentle, kind, than of\\nOur human generation you shall find\\nMany, nay, almost any.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  Honest lord,\\nThou hast said well, for some of you there present\\nAre worse than devils.\\n\\nALONSO  I cannot too much muse\\nSuch shapes, such gesture, and such sound,\\nexpressing--\\nAlthough they want the use of tongue--a kind\\nOf excellent dumb discourse.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]  Praise in departing.\\n[Inviting the King, etc., to eat, the shapes depart.]\\n\\nFRANCISCO  They vanished strangely.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  No matter, since\\nThey have left their viands behind, for we have\\nstomachs.\\nWill \\'t please you taste of what is here?\\n\\nALONSO  Not I.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nFaith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,\\nWho would believe that there were mountaineers\\nDewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at\\n\\'em\\nWallets of flesh? Or that there were such men\\nWhose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we\\nfind\\nEach putter-out of five for one will bring us\\nGood warrant of.\\n\\nALONSO  I will stand to and feed.\\nAlthough my last, no matter, since I feel\\nThe best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,\\nStand to, and do as we.\\n[Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio\\nmove toward the table.]\\n\\n[Thunder and lightning. Enter Ariel, like a Harpy, claps\\nhis wings upon the table, and with a quaint device the\\nbanquet vanishes.]\\n\\n\\nARIEL [as Harpy]\\nYou are three men of sin, whom Destiny,\\nThat hath to instrument this lower world\\nAnd what is in \\'t, the never-surfeited sea\\nHath caused to belch up you, and on this island,\\nWhere man doth not inhabit, you \\'mongst men\\nBeing most unfit to live. I have made you mad;\\nAnd even with such-like valor, men hang and drown\\nTheir proper selves.\\n[Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio draw their swords.]\\nYou fools, I and my fellows\\nAre ministers of Fate. The elements\\nOf whom your swords are tempered may as well\\nWound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabs\\nKill the still-closing waters as diminish\\nOne dowl that\\'s in my plume. My fellow ministers\\nAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,\\nYour swords are now too massy for your strengths\\nAnd will not be uplifted. But remember--\\nFor that\\'s my business to you--that you three\\nFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero,\\nExposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,\\nHim and his innocent child, for which foul deed,\\nThe powers--delaying, not forgetting--have\\nIncensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures\\nAgainst your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,\\nThey have bereft; and do pronounce by me\\nLing\\'ring perdition, worse than any death\\nCan be at once, shall step by step attend\\nYou and your ways, whose wraths to guard you\\nfrom--\\nWhich here, in this most desolate isle, else falls\\nUpon your heads--is nothing but heart\\'s sorrow\\nAnd a clear life ensuing.\\t[He vanishes in thunder.]\\n\\n[Then, to soft music, enter the shapes again, and dance,\\nwith mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.]\\n\\n\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside]\\nBravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou\\nPerformed, my Ariel. A grace it had, devouring.\\nOf my instruction hast thou nothing bated\\nIn what thou hadst to say. So, with good life\\nAnd observation strange, my meaner ministers\\nTheir several kinds have done. My high charms\\nwork,\\nAnd these mine enemies are all knit up\\nIn their distractions. They now are in my power;\\nAnd in these fits I leave them while I visit\\nYoung Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned,\\nAnd his and mine loved darling.\\t[He exits, above.]\\n\\nGONZALO, [to Alonso]\\nI\\' th\\' name of something holy, sir, why stand you\\nIn this strange stare?\\n\\nALONSO  O, it is monstrous, monstrous!\\nMethought the billows spoke and told me of it;\\nThe winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,\\nThat deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced\\nThe name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.\\nTherefor my son i\\' th\\' ooze is bedded, and\\nI\\'ll seek him deeper than e\\'er plummet sounded,\\nAnd with him there lie mudded.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  But one fiend at a time,\\nI\\'ll fight their legions o\\'er.\\n\\nANTONIO  I\\'ll be thy second.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nGONZALO\\nAll three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,\\nLike poison given to work a great time after,\\nNow \\'gins to bite the spirits.

All thy vexations\\nWere but my trials of thy love, and thou\\nHast strangely stood the test. Here afore heaven\\nI ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,\\nDo not smile at me that I boast of her,\\nFor thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise\\nAnd make it halt behind her.\\n\\nFERDINAND  I do believe it\\nAgainst an oracle.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThen, as my gift and thine own acquisition\\nWorthily purchased, take my daughter. But\\nIf thou dost break her virgin-knot before\\nAll sanctimonious ceremonies may\\nWith full and holy rite be ministered,\\nNo sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\\nTo make this contract grow; but barren hate,\\nSour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew\\nThe union of your bed with weeds so loathly\\nThat you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,\\nAs Hymen\\'s lamps shall light you.\\n\\nFERDINAND  As I hope\\nFor quiet days, fair issue, and long life,\\nWith such love as \\'tis now, the murkiest den,\\nThe most opportune place, the strong\\'st suggestion\\nOur worser genius can shall never melt\\nMine honor into lust to take away\\nThe edge of that day\\'s celebration\\nWhen I shall think or Phoebus\\' steeds are foundered\\nOr night kept chained below.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Fairly spoke.\\nSit then and talk with her. She is thine own.\\n[Ferdinand and Miranda move aside.]\\nWhat, Ariel, my industrious servant, Ariel!\\n\\n[Enter Ariel.]\\n\\n\\nARIEL\\nWhat would my potent master? Here I am.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nThou and thy meaner fellows your last service\\nDid worthily perform, and I must use you\\nIn such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\\nO\\'er whom I give thee power, here to this place.\\nIncite them to quick motion, for I must\\nBestow upon the eyes of this young couple\\nSome vanity of mine art. It is my promise,\\nAnd they expect it from me.\\n\\nARIEL  Presently?\\n\\nPROSPERO  Ay, with a twink.\\n\\nARIEL\\n\\tBefore you can say \"Come\" and \"Go,\"\\n\\tAnd breathe twice, and cry \"So, so,\"\\n\\tEach one, tripping on his toe,\\n\\tWill be here with mop and mow.\\n\\tDo you love me, master? No?\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nDearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach\\nTill thou dost hear me call.\\n\\nARIEL  Well; I conceive.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]\\nLook thou be true; do not give dalliance\\nToo much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw\\nTo th\\' fire i\\' th\\' blood. Be more abstemious,\\nOr else goodnight your vow.\\n\\nFERDINAND  I warrant you, sir,\\nThe white cold virgin snow upon my heart\\nAbates the ardor of my liver.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Well.--\\nNow come, my Ariel. Bring a corollary\\nRather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly.\\n[Soft music.]\\nNo tongue. All eyes. Be silent.\\n\\n[Enter Iris.]\\n\\n\\nIRIS\\nCeres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\\nOf wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;\\nThy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\\nAnd flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep;\\nThy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\\nWhich spongy April at thy hest betrims\\nTo make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy\\nbroom groves,\\nWhose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\\nBeing lass-lorn; thy poll-clipped vineyard,\\nAnd thy sea marge, sterile and rocky hard,\\nWhere thou thyself dost air--the Queen o\\' th\\' sky,\\nWhose wat\\'ry arch and messenger am I,\\nBids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,\\nHere on this grass-plot, in this very place,\\nTo come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.\\nApproach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.\\n\\n[Enter Ceres.]\\n\\n\\nCERES\\nHail, many-colored messenger, that ne\\'er\\nDost disobey the wife of Jupiter;\\nWho with thy saffron wings upon my flowers\\nDiffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;\\nAnd with each end of thy blue bow dost crown\\nMy bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,\\nRich scarf to my proud Earth. Why hath thy queen\\nSummoned me hither to this short-grassed green?\\n\\nIRIS\\nA contract of true love to celebrate,\\nAnd some donation freely to estate\\nOn the blest lovers.\\n\\nCERES  Tell me, heavenly bow,\\nIf Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\\nDo now attend the Queen? Since they did plot\\nThe means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\\nHer and her blind boy\\'s scandaled company\\nI have forsworn.\\n\\nIRIS  Of her society\\nBe not afraid. I met her deity\\nCutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\\nDove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have\\ndone\\nSome wanton charm upon this man and maid,\\nWhose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid\\nTill Hymen\\'s torch be lighted--but in vain.\\nMars\\'s hot minion is returned again;\\nHer waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\\nSwears he will shoot no more, but play with\\nsparrows,\\nAnd be a boy right out.\\n\\n[Juno descends.]\\n\\n\\nCERES  Highest queen of state,\\nGreat Juno, comes.

May I be bold\\nTo think these spirits?\\n\\nPROSPERO  Spirits, which by mine art\\nI have from their confines called to enact\\nMy present fancies.\\n\\nFERDINAND  Let me live here ever.\\nSo rare a wondered father and a wise\\nMakes this place paradise.\\n[Juno and Ceres whisper,\\nand send Iris on employment.]\\n\\nPROSPERO  Sweet now, silence.\\nJuno and Ceres whisper seriously.\\nThere\\'s something else to do. Hush, and be mute,\\nOr else our spell is marred.\\n\\nIRIS\\nYou nymphs, called naiads of the windring brooks,\\nWith your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,\\nLeave your crisp channels and on this green land\\nAnswer your summons, Juno does command.\\nCome, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate\\nA contract of true love. Be not too late.\\n\\n[Enter certain Nymphs.]\\n\\nYou sunburned sicklemen, of August weary,\\nCome hither from the furrow and be merry.\\nMake holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,\\nAnd these fresh nymphs encounter every one\\nIn country footing.\\n\\n[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited. They join with\\nthe Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end\\nwhereof Prospero starts suddenly and speaks.]\\n\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nI had forgot that foul conspiracy\\nOf the beast Caliban and his confederates\\nAgainst my life. The minute of their plot\\nIs almost come.--Well done. Avoid. No more.\\n[To a strange, hollow, and confused noise,\\nthe spirits heavily vanish.]\\n\\nFERDINAND, [to Miranda]\\nThis is strange. Your father\\'s in some passion\\nThat works him strongly.\\n\\nMIRANDA  Never till this day\\nSaw I him touched with anger, so distempered.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]\\nYou do look, my son, in a moved sort,\\nAs if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir.\\nOur revels now are ended. These our actors,\\nAs I foretold you, were all spirits and\\nAre melted into air, into thin air;\\nAnd like the baseless fabric of this vision,\\nThe cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\\nAnd, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\\nLeave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\\nIs rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.\\nBear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled.\\nBe not disturbed with my infirmity.\\nIf you be pleased, retire into my cell\\nAnd there repose. A turn or two I\\'ll walk\\nTo still my beating mind.\\n\\nFERDINAND/MIRANDA  We wish your peace.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Ariel.]\\n\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nCome with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come.\\n\\nARIEL\\nThy thoughts I cleave to. What\\'s thy pleasure?\\n\\nPROSPERO  Spirit,\\nWe must prepare to meet with Caliban.\\n\\nARIEL\\nAy, my commander. When I presented Ceres,\\nI thought to have told thee of it, but I feared\\nLest I might anger thee.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nSay again, where didst thou leave these varlets?\\n\\nARIEL\\nI told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,\\nSo full of valor that they smote the air\\nFor breathing in their faces, beat the ground\\nFor kissing of their feet; yet always bending\\nTowards their project. Then I beat my tabor,\\nAt which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their\\nears,\\nAdvanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses\\nAs they smelt music. So I charmed their ears\\nThat, calf-like, they my lowing followed through\\nToothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and\\nthorns,\\nWhich entered their frail shins. At last I left them\\nI\\' th\\' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\\nThere dancing up to th\\' chins, that the foul lake\\nO\\'erstunk their feet.\\n\\nPROSPERO  This was well done, my bird.\\nThy shape invisible retain thou still.\\nThe trumpery in my house, go bring it hither\\nFor stale to catch these thieves.\\n\\nARIEL  I go, I go.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nA devil, a born devil, on whose nature\\nNurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\\nHumanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;\\nAnd as with age his body uglier grows,\\nSo his mind cankers.

If I\\nshould take a displeasure against you, look you--\\n\\nTRINCULO  Thou wert but a lost monster.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nGood my lord, give me thy favor still.\\nBe patient, for the prize I\\'ll bring thee to\\nShall hoodwink this mischance.

No noise, and enter.\\nDo that good mischief which may make this island\\nThine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,\\nFor aye thy foot-licker.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody\\nthoughts.\\n\\nTRINCULO, [seeing the apparel]  O King Stephano, O\\npeer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe\\nhere is for thee!\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nLet it alone, thou fool. It is but trash.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Oho, monster, we know what belongs to a\\nfrippery. [He puts on one of the gowns.] O King\\nStephano!\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand,\\nI\\'ll have that gown.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Thy Grace shall have it.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nThe dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean\\nTo dote thus on such luggage? Let \\'t alone,\\nAnd do the murder first. If he awake,\\nFrom toe to crown he\\'ll fill our skins with pinches,\\nMake us strange stuff.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Be you quiet, monster.--Mistress Line, is\\nnot this my jerkin?\\t[He takes a jacket from the tree.]\\nNow is the jerkin under the line.--Now, jerkin, you\\nare like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Do, do. We steal by line and level, an \\'t like\\nyour Grace.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  I thank thee for that jest. Here\\'s a garment\\nfor \\'t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king\\nof this country. \"Steal by line and level\" is an excellent\\npass of pate. There\\'s another garment for \\'t.\\n\\nTRINCULO  Monster, come, put some lime upon your\\nfingers, and away with the rest.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nI will have none on \\'t. We shall lose our time\\nAnd all be turned to barnacles or to apes\\nWith foreheads villainous low.\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear\\nthis away where my hogshead of wine is, or I\\'ll turn\\nyou out of my kingdom.

There it goes, Silver!\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nFury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!\\n[Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are driven off.]\\nGo, charge my goblins that they grind their joints\\nWith dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews\\nWith aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make\\nthem\\nThan pard or cat o\\' mountain.\\n\\nARIEL  Hark, they roar.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nLet them be hunted soundly. At this hour\\nLies at my mercy all mine enemies.\\nShortly shall all my labors end, and thou\\nShalt have the air at freedom. For a little\\nFollow and do me service.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n\\n\\nACT 5\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.]\\n\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nNow does my project gather to a head.\\nMy charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time\\nGoes upright with his carriage.--How\\'s the day?\\n\\nARIEL\\nOn the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,\\nYou said our work should cease.\\n\\nPROSPERO  I did say so\\nWhen first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,\\nHow fares the King and \\'s followers?\\n\\nARIEL  Confined\\ntogether\\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\\nIn the line grove which weather-fends your cell.\\nThey cannot budge till your release. The King,\\nHis brother, and yours abide all three distracted,\\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\\nHim that you termed, sir, the good old Lord\\nGonzalo.\\nHis tears runs down his beard like winter\\'s drops\\nFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works\\n\\'em\\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\\nWould become tender.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Dost thou think so, spirit?\\n\\nARIEL\\nMine would, sir, were I human.\\n\\nPROSPERO  And mine shall.\\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply\\nPassion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?\\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to th\\'\\nquick,\\nYet with my nobler reason \\'gainst my fury\\nDo I take part. The rarer action is\\nIn virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,\\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\\nNot a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.\\nMy charms I\\'ll break, their senses I\\'ll restore,\\nAnd they shall be themselves.\\n\\nARIEL  I\\'ll fetch them, sir.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\n[Prospero draws a large circle on the stage with his staff.]\\n\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nYou elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,\\nAnd you that on the sands with printless foot\\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\\nIs to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice\\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\\nWeak masters though you be, I have bedimmed\\nThe noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,\\nAnd \\'twixt the green sea and the azured vault\\nSet roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder\\nHave I given fire, and rifted Jove\\'s stout oak\\nWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontory\\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up\\nThe pine and cedar; graves at my command\\nHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let \\'em forth\\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic\\nI here abjure, and when I have required\\nSome heavenly music, which even now I do,\\n[Prospero gestures with his staff.]\\nTo work mine end upon their senses that\\nThis airy charm is for, I\\'ll break my staff,\\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,\\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\\nI\\'ll drown my book.\\t[Solemn music.]\\n\\n[Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso with a frantic\\ngesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio in\\nlike manner attended by Adrian and Francisco. They all\\nenter the circle which Prospero had made, and there\\nstand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.]\\n\\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\\nNow useless, boiled within thy skull. There stand,\\nFor you are spell-stopped.--\\nHoly Gonzalo, honorable man,\\nMine eyes, e\\'en sociable to the show of thine,\\nFall fellowly drops.--The charm dissolves apace,\\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,\\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\\nTheir clearer reason.--O good Gonzalo,\\nMy true preserver and a loyal sir\\nTo him thou follow\\'st, I will pay thy graces\\nHome, both in word and deed.--Most cruelly\\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter.\\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.--\\nThou art pinched for \\'t now, Sebastian.--Flesh and\\nblood,\\nYou, brother mine, that entertained ambition,\\nExpelled remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian,\\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,\\nWould here have killed your king, I do forgive thee,\\nUnnatural though thou art.--Their understanding\\nBegins to swell, and the approaching tide\\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shore\\nThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them\\nThat yet looks on me or would know me.--Ariel,\\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.\\n[Ariel exits and at once returns\\nwith Prospero\\'s ducal robes.]\\nI will discase me and myself present\\nAs I was sometime Milan.--Quickly, spirit,\\nThou shalt ere long be free.\\n\\nARIEL [sings, and helps to attire him.]\\n\\n\\t   Where the bee sucks, there suck I.\\n\\t   In a cowslip\\'s bell I lie.\\n\\t   There I couch when owls do cry.\\n\\t   On the bat\\'s back I do fly\\n\\t   After summer merrily.\\n\\tMerrily, merrily shall I live now\\n\\tUnder the blossom that hangs on the bow.\\n\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nWhy, that\\'s my dainty Ariel. I shall miss\\nThee, but yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.\\nTo the King\\'s ship, invisible as thou art.\\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\\nUnder the hatches. The master and the boatswain\\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,\\nAnd presently, I prithee.\\n\\nARIEL\\nI drink the air before me, and return\\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nGONZALO\\nAll torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement\\nInhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us\\nOut of this fearful country!\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Alonso]  Behold, sir king,\\nThe wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.\\nFor more assurance that a living prince\\nDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,\\n[He embraces Alonso.]\\nAnd to thee and thy company I bid\\nA hearty welcome.\\n\\nALONSO  Whe\\'er thou be\\'st he or no,\\nOr some enchanted trifle to abuse me\\n(As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse\\nBeats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,\\nTh\\' affliction of my mind amends, with which\\nI fear a madness held me. This must crave,\\nAn if this be at all, a most strange story.\\nThy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\\nThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should\\nProspero\\nBe living and be here?\\n\\nPROSPERO, [to Gonzalo]  First, noble friend,\\nLet me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot\\nBe measured or confined.\\n\\nGONZALO  Whether this be\\nOr be not, I\\'ll not swear.\\n\\nPROSPERO  You do yet taste\\nSome subtleties o\\' th\\' isle, that will not let you\\nBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all.\\n[Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.] But you, my brace\\nof lords, were I so minded,\\nI here could pluck his Highness\\' frown upon you\\nAnd justify you traitors. At this time\\nI will tell no tales.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN, [aside]  The devil speaks in him.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside to Sebastian]  No.\\n[To Antonio.] For you, most wicked sir, whom to\\ncall brother\\nWould even infect my mouth, I do forgive\\nThy rankest fault, all of them, and require\\nMy dukedom of thee, which perforce I know\\nThou must restore.\\n\\nALONSO  If thou be\\'st Prospero,\\nGive us particulars of thy preservation,\\nHow thou hast met us here, whom three hours since\\nWere wracked upon this shore, where I have lost--\\nHow sharp the point of this remembrance is!--\\nMy dear son Ferdinand.\\n\\nPROSPERO  I am woe for \\'t, sir.\\n\\nALONSO\\nIrreparable is the loss, and patience\\nSays it is past her cure.\\n\\nPROSPERO  I rather think\\nYou have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,\\nFor the like loss, I have her sovereign aid\\nAnd rest myself content.\\n\\nALONSO  You the like loss?\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nAs great to me as late, and supportable\\nTo make the dear loss have I means much weaker\\nThan you may call to comfort you, for I\\nHave lost my daughter.\\n\\nALONSO  A daughter?\\nO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\\nThe King and Queen there! That they were, I wish\\nMyself were mudded in that oozy bed\\nWhere my son lies!--When did you lose your\\ndaughter?\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nIn this last tempest. I perceive these lords\\nAt this encounter do so much admire\\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think\\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\\nAre natural breath.--But howsoe\\'er you have\\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\\nThat I am Prospero and that very duke\\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan, who most\\nstrangely\\nUpon this shore, where you were wracked, was\\nlanded\\nTo be the lord on \\'t. No more yet of this.\\nFor \\'tis a chronicle of day by day,\\nNot a relation for a breakfast, nor\\nBefitting this first meeting. [To Alonso.] Welcome, sir.\\nThis cell\\'s my court. Here have I few attendants,\\nAnd subjects none abroad. Pray you, look in.\\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\\nI will requite you with as good a thing,\\nAt least bring forth a wonder to content you\\nAs much as me my dukedom.\\n[Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda,\\nplaying at chess.]\\n\\nMIRANDA, [to Ferdinand]\\nSweet lord, you play me false.\\n\\nFERDINAND  No, my dearest love,\\nI would not for the world.\\n\\nMIRANDA\\nYes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\\nAnd I would call it fair play.\\n\\nALONSO  If this prove\\nA vision of the island, one dear son\\nShall I twice lose.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  A most high miracle!\\n\\nFERDINAND, [seeing Alonso and coming forward]\\nThough the seas threaten, they are merciful.\\nI have cursed them without cause.\\t[He kneels.]\\n\\nALONSO  Now, all the\\nblessings\\nOf a glad father compass thee about!\\nArise, and say how thou cam\\'st here.\\n[Ferdinand stands.]\\n\\nMIRANDA, [rising and coming forward]  O wonder!\\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\\nHow beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world\\nThat has such people in \\'t!\\n\\nPROSPERO  \\'Tis new to thee.\\n\\nALONSO, [to Ferdinand]\\nWhat is this maid with whom thou wast at play?\\nYour eld\\'st acquaintance cannot be three hours.\\nIs she the goddess that hath severed us\\nAnd brought us thus together?\\n\\nFERDINAND  Sir, she is mortal,\\nBut by immortal providence she\\'s mine.\\nI chose her when I could not ask my father\\nFor his advice, nor thought I had one. She\\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\\nBut never saw before, of whom I have\\nReceived a second life; and second father\\nThis lady makes him to me.\\n\\nALONSO  I am hers.\\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\\n\\nPROSPERO  There, sir, stop.\\nLet us not burden our remembrances with\\nA heaviness that\\'s gone.\\n\\nGONZALO  I have inly wept\\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you\\ngods,\\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown,\\nFor it is you that have chalked forth the way\\nWhich brought us hither.\\n\\nALONSO  I say \"Amen,\" Gonzalo.\\n\\nGONZALO\\nWas Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue\\nShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoice\\nBeyond a common joy, and set it down\\nWith gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage\\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife\\nWhere he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom\\nIn a poor isle; and all of us ourselves\\nWhen no man was his own.\\n\\nALONSO, [to Ferdinand and Miranda]  Give me your\\nhands.\\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\\nThat doth not wish you joy!\\n\\nGONZALO  Be it so. Amen.\\n\\n[Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswain\\namazedly following.]\\n\\nO, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.\\nI prophesied if a gallows were on land,\\nThis fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\\nThat swear\\'st grace o\\'erboard, not an oath on\\nshore?\\nHast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?\\n\\nBOATSWAIN\\nThe best news is that we have safely found\\nOur king and company. The next: our ship,\\nWhich, but three glasses since, we gave out split,\\nIs tight and yare and bravely rigged as when\\nWe first put out to sea.\\n\\nARIEL, [aside to Prospero]  Sir, all this service\\nHave I done since I went.\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside to Ariel]  My tricksy spirit!\\n\\nALONSO\\nThese are not natural events. They strengthen\\nFrom strange to stranger.--Say, how came you\\nhither?\\n\\nBOATSWAIN\\nIf I did think, sir, I were well awake,\\nI\\'d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep\\nAnd--how, we know not--all clapped under\\nhatches,\\nWhere, but even now, with strange and several\\nnoises\\nOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\\nAnd more diversity of sounds, all horrible,\\nWe were awaked, straightway at liberty,\\nWhere we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\\nOur royal, good, and gallant ship, our master\\nCap\\'ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,\\nEven in a dream were we divided from them\\nAnd were brought moping hither.\\n\\nARIEL, [aside to Prospero]  Was \\'t well done?\\n\\nPROSPERO, [aside to Ariel]\\nBravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\\n\\nALONSO\\nThis is as strange a maze as e\\'er men trod,\\nAnd there is in this business more than nature\\nWas ever conduct of. Some oracle\\nMust rectify our knowledge.\\n\\nPROSPERO  Sir, my liege,\\nDo not infest your mind with beating on\\nThe strangeness of this business. At picked leisure,\\nWhich shall be shortly, single I\\'ll resolve you,\\nWhich to you shall seem probable, of every\\nThese happened accidents; till when, be cheerful\\nAnd think of each thing well. [Aside to Ariel.]\\nCome hither, spirit;\\nSet Caliban and his companions free.\\nUntie the spell. [Ariel exits.] How fares my gracious\\nsir?\\nThere are yet missing of your company\\nSome few odd lads that you remember not.\\n\\n[Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo\\nin their stolen apparel.]\\n\\n\\nSTEPHANO  Every man shift for all the rest, and let no\\nman take care for himself, for all is but fortune.\\nCoraggio, bully monster, coraggio.\\n\\nTRINCULO  If these be true spies which I wear in my\\nhead, here\\'s a goodly sight.\\n\\nCALIBAN  O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How\\nfine my master is! I am afraid he will chastise me.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Ha, ha!\\nWhat things are these, my Lord Antonio?\\nWill money buy \\'em?\\n\\nANTONIO  Very like. One of them\\nIs a plain fish and no doubt marketable.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nMark but the badges of these men, my lords,\\nThen say if they be true. This misshapen knave,\\nHis mother was a witch, and one so strong\\nThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,\\nAnd deal in her command without her power.\\nThese three have robbed me, and this demi-devil,\\nFor he\\'s a bastard one, had plotted with them\\nTo take my life. Two of these fellows you\\nMust know and own. This thing of darkness I\\nAcknowledge mine.\\n\\nCALIBAN  I shall be pinched to death.\\n\\nALONSO\\nIs not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  He is drunk now. Where had he wine?\\n\\nALONSO\\nAnd Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they\\nFind this grand liquor that hath gilded \\'em?\\n[To Trinculo.] How cam\\'st thou in this pickle?\\n\\nTRINCULO  I have been in such a pickle since I saw you\\nlast that I fear me will never out of my bones. I\\nshall not fear flyblowing.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Why, how now, Stephano?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a\\ncramp.\\n\\nPROSPERO  You\\'d be king o\\' the isle, sirrah?\\n\\nSTEPHANO  I should have been a sore one, then.\\n\\nALONSO, [indicating Caliban]\\nThis is as strange a thing as e\\'er I looked on.\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nHe is as disproportioned in his manners\\nAs in his shape. [To Caliban.] Go, sirrah, to my cell.\\nTake with you your companions. As you look\\nTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.\\n\\nCALIBAN\\nAy, that I will, and I\\'ll be wise hereafter\\nAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass\\nWas I to take this drunkard for a god,\\nAnd worship this dull fool!\\n\\nPROSPERO  Go to, away!\\n\\nALONSO, [to Stephano and Trinculo]\\nHence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN  Or stole it, rather.\\n[Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo exit.]\\n\\nPROSPERO\\nSir, I invite your Highness and your train\\nTo my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\\nFor this one night, which part of it I\\'ll waste\\nWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\\nGo quick away: the story of my life\\nAnd the particular accidents gone by\\nSince I came to this isle. And in the morn\\nI\\'ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,\\nWhere I have hope to see the nuptial\\nOf these our dear-beloved solemnized,\\nAnd thence retire me to my Milan, where\\nEvery third thought shall be my grave.\\n\\nALONSO  I long\\nTo hear the story of your life, which must\\nTake the ear strangely.\\n\\nPROSPERO  I\\'ll deliver all,\\nAnd promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,\\nAnd sail so expeditious that shall catch\\nYour royal fleet far off. [Aside to Ariel.] My Ariel,\\nchick,\\nThat is thy charge. Then to the elements\\nBe free, and fare thou well.--Please you, draw near.\\n[They all exit.]\\n\\nEPILOGUE,\\n[spoken by Prospero.]\\n============================\\n\\n\\nNow my charms are all o\\'erthrown,\\nAnd what strength I have \\'s mine own,\\nWhich is most faint. Now \\'tis true\\nI must be here confined by you,\\nOr sent to Naples. Let me not,\\nSince I have my dukedom got\\nAnd pardoned the deceiver, dwell\\nIn this bare island by your spell,\\nBut release me from my bands\\nWith the help of your good hands.\\nGentle breath of yours my sails\\nMust fill, or else my project fails,\\nWhich was to please. Now I want\\nSpirits to enforce, art to enchant,\\nAnd my ending is despair,\\nUnless I be relieved by prayer,\\nWhich pierces so that it assaults\\nMercy itself, and frees all faults.\\n   As you from crimes would pardoned be,\\n   Let your indulgence set me free.\\n[He exits.]\\n'"
